Wei Chi
Before Completion

The Judgment:
BEFORE COMPLETION. Success.
But if the little fox, after nearly 
completing the crossing,
Gets his tail in the water,
There is nothing that would further.

The Image:
Fire over water:
The image of the condition before 
transition.
Thus the superior man is careful
In the differentiation of things,
So that each finds its place.
