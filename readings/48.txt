The Well

The Judgment:
THE WELL. The town may be changed,
But the well cannot be changed.
It neither decreases nor increases.
They come and go and draw from the well.
If one gets down almost to the water
And the rope does not go all the way,
Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.

The Image:
Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.
Thus the superior man encourages the 
people at their work,
And exhorts them to help one another.
