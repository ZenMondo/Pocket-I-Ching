The Judgment:
DECREASE combined with sincerity
Brings about supreme good fortune
Without blame.
One may be persevering in this.
It furthers one to undertake something.
How is this to be carried out?
One may use two small bowls for the 
sacrifice.

The Image:
At the foot of the mountain, 
the lake: the image of DECREASE.
Thus the superior man controls his 
anger and restrains his instincts.
