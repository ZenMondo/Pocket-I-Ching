Yu
Enthusiasm

The Judgment:
ENTHUSIASM. It furthers one to install 
helpers
And to set armies marching.

The Image:
Thunder comes resounding out of the 
earth:
The image of ENTHUSIASM.
Thus the ancient kings made music 
In order to honor merit,
And offered it with splendor
To the Supreme Deity,
Inviting their ancestors to be present.
