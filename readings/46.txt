Pushing Upward

The Judgment:
PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.
One must see the great man.
Fear not.
Departure toward the south
Brings good fortune.

The Image:
Within the earth, wood grows:
The image of PUSHING UPWARD.
Thus the superior man of devoted 
character
Heaps up small things
In order to achieve something high and 
great.
