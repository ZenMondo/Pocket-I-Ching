Sung
Conflict

The Judgment:
CONFLICT. You are sincere
And are being obstructed.
A cautious halt halfway brings good 
fortune.
Going through to the end brings 
misfortune.
It furthers one to see the great man.
It does not further one to cross the 
great water.

The Image:
Heaven and water go their opposite ways:
The image of CONFLICT.
Thus in all his transactions the 
superior man
Carefully considers the beginning.
