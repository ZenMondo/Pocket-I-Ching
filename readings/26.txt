Ta Ch'u
The Taming Power of the Great

The Judgment:
THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.
Perseverance furthers.
Not eating at home brings good fortune.
It furthers one to cross the great 
water.

The Image:
Heaven within the mountain:
The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE 
GREAT.
Thus the superior man acquaints himself 
with many sayings of antiquity
And many deeds of the past,
In order to strengthen his character 
thereby.
