Dispersion [Dissolution]

The Judgment:
DISPERSION. Success.
The king approaches his temple.
It furthers one to cross the great 
water.
Perseverance furthers.

The Image:
The wind drives over the water:
The image of DISPERSION.
Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the 
Lord
And built temples.
