Ts'ui
Gathering Together [Massing]

The Judgment:
GATHERING TOGETHER. Success.
The king approaches his temple.
It furthers one to see the great man.
This brings success. Perseverance 
furthers.
To bring great offerings creates good 
fortune.
It furthers one to undertake something.

The Image:
Over the earth, the lake:
The image of GATHERING TOGETHER.
Thus the superior man renews his weapons
In order to meet the unforeseen.
