 Difficulty at the Beginning

 The Judgment:
 DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING works 
supreme success,
 Furthering through perseverance.
 Nothing should be undertaken.
 It furthers one to appoint helpers.

 The Image:
 Clouds and thunder:
 The image of DIFFICULTY AT THE 
BEGINNING.
 Thus the superior man
 Brings order out of confusion.
