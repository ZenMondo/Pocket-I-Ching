Waiting (Nourishment)

The Judgment:
WAITING. If you are sincere,
You have light and success.
Perseverance brings good fortune.
It furthers one to cross the great 
water.

The Image:
Clouds rise up to heaven:
The image of WAITING.
Thus the superior man eats and drinks,
Is joyous and of good cheer.
