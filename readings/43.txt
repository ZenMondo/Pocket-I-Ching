Break-through (Resoluteness)

The Judgment:
BREAK-THROUGH. One must resolutely make 
the matter known
At the court of the king.
It must be announced truthfully. Danger.
It is necessary to notify one's own 
city.
It does not further to resort to arms.
It furthers one to undertake something.

The Image:
The lake has risen up to heaven:
The image of BREAK-THROUGH.
Thus the superior man
Dispenses riches downward
And refrains from resting on his virtue.
