Kuan
Contemplation (View)

The Judgment:
CONTEMPLATION. The ablution has been 
made,
But not yet the offering.
Full of trust they look up to him.

The Image:
The wind blows over the earth:
The image of CONTEMPLATION.
Thus the kings of old visited the 
regions of the world,
Contemplated the people,
And gave them instruction.
