The Clinging, Fire

The Judgment:
THE CLINGING. Perseverance furthers.
It brings success.
Care of the cow brings good fortune.

The Image:
That which is bright rises twice:
The image of FIRE.
Thus the great man, by perpetuating 
this brightness,
Illumines the four quarters of the 
world.
