Innocence (The Unexpected)

The Judgment:
INNOCENCE. Supreme success.
Perseverance furthers. 
If someone is not as he should be,
He has misfortune,
And it does not further him
To undertake anything.

The Image:
Under heaven thunder rolls:
All things attain the natural state of 
innocence.
Thus the kings of old,
Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the 
time,
Fostered and nourished all beings.
