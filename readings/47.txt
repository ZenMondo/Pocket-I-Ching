K'un
Oppression (Exhaustion)

The Judgment:
OPPRESSION. Success. Perseverance. 
The great man brings about good fortune.
No blame.
When one has something to say,
It is not believed.

The Image:
There is not water in the lake:
The image of EXHAUSTION.
Thus the superior man stakes his life
On following his will.
