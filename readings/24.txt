Return (The Turning Point)

The Judgment:
RETURN. Success.
Going out and coming in without error.
Friends come without blame.
To and fro goes the way.
On the seventh day comes return.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

The Image:
Thunder within the earth: 
the image of THE TURNING POINT.
Thus the kings of antiquity closed the 
passes 
at the time of the solstice. 
Merchants and strangers did not go 
about, 
and the ruler did not travel through 
the provinces.
