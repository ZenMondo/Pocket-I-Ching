Preponderance of the Great

The Judgment:
PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.
The ridgepole sags to the breaking 
point.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
Success.

The Image:
The lake rises above the trees:
The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.
Thus the superior man, when he stands 
alone,
Is unconcerned,
And if he has to renounce the world,
He is undaunted.
