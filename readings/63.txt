After Completion

The Judgment:
AFTER COMPLETION. Success in small 
matters.
Perseverance furthers.
At the beginning good fortune.
At the end disorder.

The Image:
Water over fire: the image of the 
condition
In AFTER COMPLETION.
Thus the superior man
Takes thought of misfortune
And arms himself against it in advance.
