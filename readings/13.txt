T'ung Jen
Fellowship with Men

The Judgment:
FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.
Success.
It furthers one to cross the great 
water.
The perseverance of the superior man 
furthers.

The Image:
Heaven together with fire:
The image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.
Thus the superior man organizes the 
clans
And makes distinctions between things.
