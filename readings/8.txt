Pi
Holding Together [union]

The Judgment:
HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.
Inquire of the oracle once again
Whether you possess sublimity, 
constancy, and perseverance;
Then there is no blame.
Those who are uncertain gradually join.
Whoever comes too late
Meets with misfortune.

The Image:
On the earth is water:
The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.
Thus the kings of antiquity
Bestowed the different states as fiefs
And cultivated friendly relations
With the feudal lords.
