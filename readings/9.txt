Hsiao Ch'u
The Taming Power of the Small

The Judgment:
THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL
Has success.
Dense clouds, no rain from our western 
region.

The Image:
The wind drives across heaven:
The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE 
SMALL.
Thus the superior man
Refines the outward aspect of his 
nature.
