Hsiao Kuo
Preponderance of the Small

The Judgment:
PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Success.
Perseverance furthers.
Small things may be done; great things 
should not be done.
The flying bird brings the message:
It is not well to strive upward,
It is well to remain below.
Great good fortune. 

The Image:
Thunder on the mountain:
The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL.
Thus in his conduct the superior man 
gives preponderance to reverence.
In bereavement he gives preponderance 
to grief.
In his expenditures he gives 
preponderance to thrift.
