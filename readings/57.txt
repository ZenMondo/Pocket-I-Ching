Sun
The Gentle (The Penetrating, Wind)

The Judgment:
THE GENTLE. Success through what is 
small.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
It furthers one to see the great man.

The Image:
Winds following one upon the other:
The image of THE GENTLY PENETRATING.
Thus the superior man
Spreads his commands abroad
And carries out his undertakings.
