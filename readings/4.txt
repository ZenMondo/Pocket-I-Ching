 Youthful Folly

The Judgment:
YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.
It is not I who seek the young fool
The young fool seeks me.
At the first oracle I inform him.
If he asks two or three times, it is 
importunity.
If he importunes, I give him no 
information.
Perseverance furthers.

The Image:
A spring wells up at the foot of the 
mountain:
The image of YOUTH.
Thus the superior man fosters his 
character
By thoroughness in all that he does.
