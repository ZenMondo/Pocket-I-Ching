P'i
Standstill [Stagnation]

The Judgment:
STANDSTILL. Evil people do not further
The perseverance of the superior man.
The great departs; the small approaches.

The Image:
Heaven and earth do not unite:
The image of STANDSTILL.
Thus the superior man falls back upon 
his inner worth
In order to escape the difficulties.
He does not permit himself to be 
honored with revenue.
