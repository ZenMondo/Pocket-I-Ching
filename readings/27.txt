Corners of the Mouth (Providing 
Nourishment)

The Judgment:
"THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.
Perseverance brings good fortune.
Pay heed to the providing of nourishment
And to what a man seeks
To fill his own mouth with.

The Image:
At the foot of the mountain, thunder:
The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT.
Thus the superior man is careful of his 
words
And temperate in eating and drinking.
