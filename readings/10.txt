Treading [conduct]

The Judgment:
TREADING. Treading upon the tail of the 
tiger.
It does not bite the man. Success.

The Image:
Heaven above, the lake below:
The image of TREADING.
Thus the superior man discriminates 
between high and low,
And thereby fortifies the thinking of 
the people.
