K'an
The Abysmal (Water)

The Judgment:
The Abysmal repeated.
If you are sincere, you have success in 
your heart,
And whatever you do succeeds.

The Image:
Water flows on uninterruptedly and 
reaches its foal:
The image of the Abysmal repeated.
Thus the superior man walks in lasting 
virtue 
And carries on the business of teaching.
