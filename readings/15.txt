Ch'ien
Modesty

The Judgment:
MODESTY creates success.
The superior man carries things through.

The Image:
Within the earth, a mountain:
The image of MODESTY.
Thus the superior man reduces that 
which is too much,
And augments that which is too little.
He weighs things and makes them equal.
