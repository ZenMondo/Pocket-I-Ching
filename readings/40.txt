Deliverance

The Judgment:
DELIVERANCE. The southwest furthers.
If there is no longer anything where 
one has to go,
Return brings good fortune.
If there is still something where one 
has to go,
Hastening brings good fortune.

The Image:
Thunder and rain set in:
The image of DELIVERANCE.
Thus the superior man pardons mistakes
And forgives misdeeds.
