K'un
The Receptive

The Judgment:
THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime 
success, 
Furthering through the perseverance of 
a mare.
If the superior man undertakes 
something and tries to lead,
He goes astray; 
But if he follows, he finds guidance. 
It is favorable to find friends in the 
west and south,
To forego friends in the east and north.
Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.

The Image:
The earth's condition is receptive 
devotion.
Thus the superior man who has breadth 
of character
Carries the outer world.
